# di-builder
This project offers a graphical interface to design deep inference (DI) deductions for use with the Virginia Lake LaTeX macro set. The latest main build can be found at https://di-builder.tomdufall.co.uk
It is free to use, self-host, or fork. Please credit the original author in any derivative works.

DI builder was developed as a final year project by Tom Dufall, a computer science graduate who knows very little about DI other than its deduction structure. This was very much a learning experience in HTML5 and JavaScript, and is far from perfect - it's more of a working tool than a polished product. Since submitting my dissertation, it has not been under active development, but any suggested functionality or pull requests are welcome, and it may be updated from time to time. You can contact me at di@tomdufall.co.uk.

I would like to thank Alessio Guglielmi for providing the overview of DI and open deduction needed to create this, as well as his support as a project supervisor. You can find out more about DI here: http://alessio.guglielmi.name/res/cos/index.html
